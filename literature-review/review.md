    - When an economic agent does not bear the full cost or full fruit of her actions, a moral
      hazard may arise in which the agent, through doing what is personally optimal, behaves in ways
      that are sub-optimal from a social standpoint (Holmstrom 1979)

> The degree to which elected representatives have a duty first to serve the
constituencies that elected them (e.g. paying particular attention to jobs
and investment in their own constituencies) is also by no means a settled
public debate.

> When managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected, irrespective of the workers ability. When they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort towards high ability workers, irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not.

> Favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firms overall performance..
> Social connections span across layers of the hierachy

and may explain a documented relationship between social networks and firm

> There's a possibility that peer education increases social capital; another possibility is that we learn social skills in school, or that individuals with high levels of human capital get relatively high levels of utility out of social interaction.  
> People who belong to groups with more social capital will tend to invest more in social capital themselves.

> This paper seeks to understand what motivates workers to be altruis- tic toward one another and studies whether firms benefit from en- couraging these "human relations" in the workplace. The paper first proposes that feelings of altruism can be individually rational in certain settings in which the variables controlled by the workers are strategically linked. The paper then studies what this implies for equilibrium altruism in two situations. The first has workers who are paid as a function of joint output. The second is the relationship between subordinates and their supervisors.
> People have feelings for those they work with. This raises two ques-
tions: first, whether these feelings affect performance on the job and,
second, what gives rise to these feelings

> - Input from corporate leaders, especially CEOs as occupying the most powerful position in organizations, is important as they can help with
coordinating multiple organizational resources,
functions, and businesses.
> - The involvement of corporate leaders is beneficial for converting new technologies into new  products if the characteristics of CEO human capital are aligned with the characteristics of  the company’s portfolio of inventions.
> - In companies with more diverse and/or higher  quality invention portfolios, it is important that CEOs have general human capital; while companies with invention portfolios of low to moderate levels of diversity and/or quality would benefit from appointing CEOs with specialist human capital.

> a research gap remains in the literature concerning how the CEO’s knowledge,skills, and professional experiences—known as human capital attributes—may matter to the chief executive’s ability to facilitate technology conversion in their companies. Research that draws on human capital and upper echelons theories demonstrates that the CEO’s expertise and knowledge repertoire have a substantial influence on the key strategic choices and performance levels of the company

> Specifically, having an organizational posture that, at once, values innovation plus globalization, as well as a senior management that is active in and supports the international NPD effort leads to strategic choices that are focused on making the firm truly global in terms of both market coverage and product offering. Further, the two strategies—global presence and global product harmonization—were found to be significant mediators of the firm’s behavioral environment in terms of impact on performance of global NPD programs.
