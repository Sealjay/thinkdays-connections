## Social Connections
<div class="csl-entry"><i>Do Social Connections Reduce Moral Hazard? Evidence from the New York City Taxi Industry</i>. (2010). [Book]. National Bureau of Economic Research.</div>

- *Key Themes*: Moral Hazard, Social Connections, Network Effects
- *Summary*: Study of the New York taxi industry, finding that social connections have a significant impact on the moral hazard of the taxi industry.
    - When an economic agent does not bear the full cost or full fruit of her actions, a moral
      hazard may arise in which the agent, through doing what is personally optimal, behaves in ways
      that are sub-optimal from a social standpoint (Holmstrom 1979)

> The degree to which elected representatives have a duty first to serve the
constituencies that elected them (e.g. paying particular attention to jobs
and investment in their own constituencies) is also by no means a settled
public debate.

and may explain a documented relationship between social networks and firm
economic performance

> There's a possibility that peer education increases social capital; another possibility is that we learn social skills in school, or that individuals with high levels of human capital get relatively high levels of utility out of social interaction.  
> People who belong to groups with more social capital will tend to invest more in social capital themselves.

"The Commitment Device"
> Thomas Schelling (1960) provides a vivid illustration of this class of problems. He describes a kidnapper who suddenly gets cold feet. He wants to set his victim free, but is afraid he will go to the police. In return for his freedom, the victim gladly promises not to do so. The problem, of course, is that both realize that it will no longer be in his interest to keep this promise once he is free. And so the kidnapper reluctantly concludes he must kill his victim.
> Schelling suggests the following way out of the dilemma: "If the victim has commited an offense whose disclosure would lead to blackmail, he may confess it; if not, he might commit one in the presence of his captor, to create a bond that will ensure his silence" (1960, pp. 43-44). The blackmailable act serves here as a "commitment device," something that provides the victim with an incentive to keep his promise. The need for such devices arises frequently in the course of economic interaction.

"The Conscience as a Commitment Device"
> Consider, for example, a person with the capacity to experience strong feelings of guilt upon breaking a promise-that is, a person with a conscience. This person will often honor his promises even when material incentives favor breaking them. It is pre-  cisely this capacity of emotional forces to override rational calculations that makes them candidates for commitment devices.

## the human problems of an industrial civilisation
<div class="csl-entry">Nasirov, S., Li, Q. C., &#38; Kor, Y. Y. (2021). Converting technological inventions into new products: The role of CEO human capital [Article]. <i>The Journal of Product Innovation Management</i>, <i>38</i>(5), 522–547. https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12601</div>

> - Input from corporate leaders, especially CEOs as occupying the most powerful position in organizations, is important as they can help with
coordinating multiple organizational resources,
functions, and businesses.
> - The involvement of corporate leaders is beneficial for converting new technologies into new  products if the characteristics of CEO human capital are aligned with the characteristics of  the company’s portfolio of inventions.
> - In companies with more diverse and/or higher  quality invention portfolios, it is important that CEOs have general human capital; while companies with invention portfolios of low to moderate levels of diversity and/or quality would benefit from appointing CEOs with specialist human capital.

> a research gap remains in the literature concerning how the CEO’s knowledge,skills, and professional experiences—known as human capital attributes—may matter to the chief executive’s ability to facilitate technology conversion in their companies. Research that draws on human capital and upper echelons theories demonstrates that the CEO’s expertise and knowledge repertoire have a substantial influence on the key strategic choices and performance levels of the company

Success in Global New Product Development: Impact of Strategy and the Behavioral Environment of the Firm [Article]. <i>The Journal of Product Innovation Management</i>, <i>27</i>(2), 143–160. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2010.00707.x</div>

> Specifically, having an organizational posture that, at once, values innovation plus globalization, as well as a senior management that is active in and supports the international NPD effort leads to strategic choices that are focused on making the firm truly global in terms of both market coverage and product offering. Further, the two strategies—global presence and global product harmonization—were found to be significant mediators of the firm’s behavioral environment in terms of impact on performance of global NPD programs.

> Typically the mistake lies in a failure to grasp the severity of the free rider problem, which so efectively filters out most forms of altruistic behavior from other sexually reproducing species
> “altruism is often defned by evolutionary biologists— humorously but pointedly—as ‘that which cannot evolve’”
> Natural selection will tend to promote selfshness, which is to say, traits that increase the direct ftness of the individual that possesses them, while possibly decreasing the ftness of others
> There are, of course, certain well-known answers to this question—exceptions to the general rule that natural selection precludes altruism. These are kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and group selection

## organizational theory

> This paper seeks to understand what motivates workers to be altruis- tic toward one another and studies whether firms benefit from en- couraging these "human relations" in the workplace. The paper first proposes that feelings of altruism can be individually rational in certain settings in which the variables controlled by the workers are strategically linked. The paper then studies what this implies for equilibrium altruism in two situations. The first has workers who are paid as a function of joint output. The second is the relationship between subordinates and their supervisors.
> People have feelings for those they work with. This raises two ques-
tions: first, whether these feelings affect performance on the job and,
second, what gives rise to these feelings

> When managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected, irrespective of the workers ability. When they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort towards high ability workers, irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not.
> [..]
> Favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firms overall performance..
> Social connections span across layers of the hierachy

> [..] emphasizes that behavior is often best predicted by the analysis of group as well as individual incentives; and it gropes toward a precise definition of concepts such as "power," "cliques," "corporate politics," and "bureaucracy"
> emphasizes the productive inefficiency associated  with asymmetric information and insurance motives (or limited liability constraints).' Formally, organizations can be seen as networks of overlapping or  nested principal/agent relationships.
> This research departs from the existing information economics literature in that it views an organization as a network of contracts that interplay rather than as a single contract
> The consideration of coalitions in incentive theory certainly deserves some motivation. It raises the questions of how coalitions can form and whether they, in fact, do form.

- Notes: Principal, supervisor, agent hierarchies - usually hard to get information from intermediate levels of a hierarchy.

> Manipulation of information is also very common when a shop or a group of employees decides not to implement changes it did not originate.
> [..] face-to-face relationships, and includes mutual affection and respect. It applies even to relationships that are not repeated. It is just very unpleasant to hurt someone one is facing.

- Notes: Physical interaction is just plain important.
