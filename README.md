## Documentation
The `docs` folder contains [more detailed documentation](./docs/start-here.md), along with setup instructions.

```
Add an optional installation or usage section, if the instructions are short.
e.g.
## Getting started
You can use a [dev container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/app-development/container-build-vscode?&WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-500420) to run this in VS Code, or in [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

### Cloud Resources
You'll need to deploy an [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) resource; and an Azure App Service if you want to host this. Right now, the [Bicep file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?&WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-500420) is not complete.

## Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome! This repository uses [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - with [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly) to enforce semantic commits (`npm install -g commitizen cz-customizable`, `echo '{ "path": "cz-customizable" }' > ~/.czrc`, and then `git cz`- easy to setup!)

**Note: This adds a .czrc file to your home directory, and will overwrite existing commitzen .czrc files.**
