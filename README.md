> An exploration of how humans make connections to build trust.

This repository exists to demonstrate research around humans building trust and connection.

It's also a pretty good example of using [DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-apps/microservices-dapr?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204) with [Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004204).

## Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome! This repository uses [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - with [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly) to enforce semantic commits (`npm install -g commitizen cz-customizable`, `echo '{ "path": "cz-customizable" }' > ~/.czrc`, and then `git cz`- easy to setup!)

**Note: This adds a .czrc file to your home directory, and will overwrite existing commitzen .czrc files.**
